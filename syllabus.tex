\section*{Course Description}
\paragraph{}This course is designed to provide an introduction to problem solving and computer programming that does not require prior programming experience. Elementary problem solving skills and algorithm development will be introduced. Students will be taught the basic use of a programming environment and basic programming constructs (including loops, control statements, functions, and arrays). This course also teaches students the fundamentals of using the UNIX operating system, and introduces general computer science concepts.

\paragraph{Note:}This course does not fulfill any of the computer science major requirements. Students who have taken and received transfer credit for, or who are taking concurrently any computer programming course in a high-level programming language, will not receive credit for CMSC 104. The list of such computer programming courses includes, but is not limited to AP Computer Science, CMSC 201, CMSC 202, and sections of CMSC 291 that cover programming topics.

The following is a list of the topics that will be covered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction to Computer Organization and Architecture
\item Data Representation and Memory Usage
\item Introduction to Operating Systems (Linux)
\item Introduction to Software Engineering Using Top-Down Design
\item Programming in C
\item Problem Solving and Algorithm Development
\end{itemize}

\section*{Overall Course Objectives}
\paragraph{}After completion of this course, students will be able to:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item describe basic computer hardware and software,
    \item navigate the Linux command line using UMBC's Linux GL environment,
    \item create, edit, and remove files and directories in Unix,
    \item write C programs with loops, control statements, functions, and arrays that compile and solve their intended problems.
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\section*{Course Textbook}
\textbf{C How to Program} by Deitel \& Deitel, Eighth Edition. Pearson, ISBN 978-0133976892.

\section*{Course Work}\label{sec:coursework}
\paragraph{Attendance}It is important to be present for each class, though it's up to each individual student to best manage their own time. This is your time to have regular interaction with the instructor and Teaching Fellow, to ask questions, ask for specific examples, seek clarification, etc. I cannot overstate the importance of being able to ask questions and engage in dialog to help facilitate the learning process. \textbf{The students who end up being the most successful are the ones who regularly attend \underline{and} ask questions!}

\paragraph{Classwork \& Homework}Assignments will be submitted using the submit system on GL (ssh userID@gl.umbc.edu). All assignments are due precisely one week after being assigned. For example, Classwork 1 is assigned on Tuesday, January 31\textsuperscript{st}, therefore the due date is 11:59 PM on Tuesday, February 7\textsuperscript{th}. An example of the submit command: \texttt{submit cs104 cw1 proj.txt file2.ext}. Assignments may be completed early, but \underline{\hypertarget{cwhw}{late assignments} will \textbf{not} be accepted}\footnote{Late assignments may be accepted \textit{only} in the event of a documented extenuating circumstance.}.

\paragraph{Coding Assignments}Most of the assignments for classwork and homework ones in which you the student writes code to complete a given task. Each assignment indicates what the task is, and most assignments have examples as to how the program should behave. \textbf{Therefore, for coding assignments, there's no reason why each student shouldn't get 100\% on each assignment, since you'll know \underline{before} turning it in whether or not your code works, and the assignments indicate how the program should work!}

\paragraph{Software} Windows users will need Putty \url{https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html} and WinSCP \url{https://winscp.net/eng/index.php} for connecting to the UMBC Linux servers and transferring files\footnote{Alternatively, Windows users install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).}. Both programs are free. Mac users may want to use Cyberduck \url{https://cyberduck.io/} or Transmit \url{https://panic.com/transmit/} to help with file transfers, but this isn't required, as the Mac command line (\texttt{Terminal.app}) allows for SSH connections and file transfers natively.

\paragraph{Quizzes}There are five quizzes, and they will be held during the first 40 minutes of the class in which they're administered. The best ways to study for the quiz is to attend class, ask questions, and complete the assignments. Each quiz will focus on the materials since the quiz prior, including assigned readings, and will be \textit{cumulative}. Quizzes will be administered using the Respondus Lockdown Browser in Blackboard, so please read the following section for details on how to set it up and use it. There will be a practice quiz early in the semester to ensure everyone can use the system.

\paragraph{LockDown Browser}This course uses the LockDown Browser for online exams. Watch this short video to get a basic understanding of LockDown Browser and the optional webcam feature (which may be required for some exams) \url{http://www.respondus.com/products/lockdown-browser/student-movie.shtml}. Then download and install LockDown Browser from this link: \url{http://www.respondus.com/lockdown/download.php?id=978442813}. NOTE: This link is unique for UMBC. It cannot be used by non-UMBC students or websites outside of our campus. To take an online test, start LockDown Browser and navigate to the exam. You won't be able to access the exam with a standard web browser. For additional details on using LockDown Browser, review this FAQ \url{https://wiki.umbc.edu/x/BQb9Aw} or the Respondus Student Quick Start Guide (PDF) \url{http://respondus.com/products/lockdown-browser/guides.shtml#student}. Finally, when taking an online exam, follow these guidelines:
\begin{itemize}
%\item Select a location where you won't be interrupted
\item Before starting the test, know how much time is available for it, and that you've allotted sufficient time to complete it;
\item Turn off all mobile devices, phones, etc. and don't have them within reach;
%\item Clear your area of all external materials — books, papers, other computers, or devices
\item Remain at your desk or workstation for the duration of the quiz or exam;
\item LockDown Browser will prevent you from accessing other websites or applications; you will be unable to exit the test until all questions are completed and submitted.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Exams}There will be one exam, the final, which will also use the LockDown Browser. It is designed to reinforce the topics discussed throughout the semester in order to promote retention of the information.

\section*{Course Policies}
\subsection*{Grading}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c || c c}
\multicolumn{2}{c||}{\underline{Scale}} & \underline{Course Work} & \underline{Grade Distribution} \\
90\%-100\% & A & Classwork & 15\% \\
80\%-89\% & B & Homework & 25\% \\
70\%-79\% & C & Quizzes & 30\% \\ 
60\%-69\% & D & Final Exam & 30\% \\
$<$60\%     & F & 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{}For borderline grades, there may be adjustments in the student's favor based on attendance, but under no circumstances will the letter grades be lower than in the standard formula. Grades will not be ``curved'' in the sense that the percentages of A's, B's and C's are not fixed. As a guideline, a student receiving an ``A'' should be able to produce correct programs for the homework assignments and quizzes with ease. As stated in the \hyperlink{cwhw}{Classwork \& Homework} section, late work will not be accepted.

\subsection*{Academic Integrity}
\paragraph{}By enrolling is this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC's scholarly community in which everyone's academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal. To find useful information about avoiding plagiarism infractions through appropriate citations, or to read the full policy regarding student academic misconduct for the graduate school, please see \url{http://www.umbc.edu/provost/integrity}.

\paragraph{}You are allowed \& \textit{encouraged} to discuss course materials with your peers! However, \underline{all assignments} \underline{are an individual effort!} Assignments will be checked for evidence of shared or copied code. If you have questions, or find that you are struggling, please ask questions, \underline{do not share code}\textbf{!}

\section*{Schedule}
\textit{Note: The schedule is subject to change. However, any changes will be thoroughly discussed and well disseminated. The lecture \& textbook topics might not align, that's okay, please read the chapter before class starts anyway.}
